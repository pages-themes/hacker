A customer experience centered individual, having 6+ years management experience building and growing web & mobile products, business planning & project management. Whilst working on tools for developing a user experience, my priority has always been to reach out to the end users & stakeholders for understanding what their actual requirement is. The mantra “Learn. Build. Deliver. Relearn.” drives me to achieving my goals.
Prior to my current engagement as a PM at Samsung Research Bangalore, I had a 2-year stint at Daimler India Commercial Vehicles (Chennai). I hold a master’s degree in Business Administration from IIM Ranchi and bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from NIT, Karnataka
