# Whoami
Welcome to the blog of your friendly neighbourhood hacker.

I'm Schizzy, a mid 20 something tech enthusiast and professional button pusher. I've been poking around with computers ever since my first laptop, and I love to deep dive into topics such as Reverse Engineering, Malware Analysis, Capture the Flags, and other nerdy things! It is my hope that you learn something from me even if that's a new way to fail at something. I will be documenting my progress through CTFs, code projects, and whatever else interests me.

## What's next?
* HackTheBox Writeups
* Describing the method to my madness
* Rust projects (Some already completed ones are things like a port scanner)
* C++ Projects (If you have suggestions, please lmk!)
* Having fun with Lua - a really nice scripting language
* Exploit development and mitigation techniques
* More to come.

Thank you for reading!
